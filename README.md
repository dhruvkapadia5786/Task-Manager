## Future Enhancements: Taking My Task Manager App to the Next Level

While you’ve successfully created a basic task manager app, there’s always room for improvement and additional features. Here are some ideas for future enhancements to make your app even more useful and user-friendly:

1. Task Categories and Filtering: Allow users to categorize tasks and provide filtering options to view tasks based on their categories. This can help users organize and manage their tasks more effectively.
2. Task Prioritization: Add the ability to set task priorities, such as high, medium, and low. Users can then sort tasks based on their priority levels.
3. Task Due Dates and Reminders: Enable users to set due dates for tasks and receive reminders or notifications to complete tasks on time.
4. Task Notes and Attachments: Allow users to add notes or attach files to tasks, providing additional context or resources related to each task.
5. User Accounts and Data Persistence: Implement user authentication and data persistence, so users can save their tasks across sessions and access them securely.
6. Drag and Drop Reordering: Implement a drag-and-drop feature to reorder tasks in the list, giving users greater control over the arrangement of tasks.
7. Task Sharing and Collaboration: Introduce task-sharing capabilities, allowing users to collaborate on tasks with others and assign tasks to team members.
8. Dark Mode: Offer a dark mode option to enhance user experience and reduce eye strain, especially during late-night usage.
9. Task Analytics and Insights: Provide users with visual analytics and insights on task completion rates, trends, and productivity statistics.
10. Mobile App Version: Develop a mobile app version of your task manager to extend its usability and reach to mobile device users.
